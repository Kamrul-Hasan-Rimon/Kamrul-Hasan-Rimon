## About Me

I’m a MERN‑stack developer who builds fast, accessible, and maintainable web applications. I love turning product ideas into polished, production‑ready experiences — from UX to backend APIs. Currently building **FlexFit**, a fitness platform for tracking progress, booking trainers, and managing roles (admin/trainer/member).

* 🔭 Currently: Building **FlexFit** (MERN) — auth, role management, booking flow, and community forum.
  Built: **Modern Hotel** — a hotel booking & management platform (see Projects).
* 🌱 Learning & Building: Next.js, TypeScript, Redux — actively building projects and demos using these technologies (SSR/SSG, dashboard flows, and full‑stack integrations). Also continuing Advanced React (hooks & patterns), GSAP, Framer Motion, and UI/UX with Figma.
* 👯 Open to: Junior frontend / full‑stack roles, freelance projects, and open‑source collaboration.

---

## Key Strengths & Value

* **End‑to‑end MERN experience:** building responsive UIs with React, state management, REST/GraphQL APIs, and MongoDB persistence.
* **Product focus:** I ship features that users can interact with and iterate on quickly (auth, role‑based flows, booking/payment stubs, dashboards).
* **Clean code & teamwork:** disciplined Git habits, clear commits, and readable code with tests where appropriate.
